1. Package description
----------------------
 
biblatex-fiwi is a collection of styles for the biblatex package. It was designed for citations in German Humanities, especially film studies, and offers some features which are not provided by the standard biblatex styles. biblatex-fiwi dependend on biblatex (version 1.7 at least) and cannot be used without it!
 
Since the style in its current incarnation is highly optimized for documents written in German, the main documentation is only available in German. If there is enough interest, I could add English documentation at a later point.
 
Any suggestions concerning this package are highly appreciated.
 
 
2. Installation
